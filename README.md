# 📺 YouTube Clone - HTML & CSS Only

Hey there! This is my very first web development project – a **YouTube-inspired homepage clone** built purely with **HTML and CSS** while I was learning the basics.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a beginner-level clone and not fully responsive or interactive (yet!). I'll keep enhancing it as I learn more about JavaScript and responsive design.
